        <h2>Welcome to My Professional Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Camden Dougherty, and I’m excited to share my work with you! With a background in information technology, business management, and creative presentation, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and artistic vision to every project I take on. Here, you’ll find a collection of my work across multiple disciplines, including coding, photography, merchandise presentation, and 3D modeling.

About Me
I have a strong foundation in information technology and am currently pursuing my degree in Information Technology at Southern New Hampshire University, expecting to graduate in 2025. My technical background includes working with languages like SQL, Python, Java, and HTML, which I have applied in projects related to data analysis, web development, and automation. Alongside my technical expertise, I have extensive experience in business operations and leadership, having spent several years managing a multi-location restaurant business, overseeing daily operations, event planning, and employee coordination.

My Experience
My professional journey has been shaped by problem-solving, leadership, and adaptability. From 2013 to 2019, I managed my family’s restaurant business across four locations in Knoxville, Rocky Top, and Norris, TN. During this time, I handled event coordination, team leadership, and strategic business expansion discussions. I was directly involved in developing partnerships to expand our brand presence, which included negotiating product placements in retail and tourist locations. This experience strengthened my skills in project management, operations, and creative business solutions.

I created this space to showcase my work and share my passion for technology, creativity, and innovation. Whether it’s developing software solutions, capturing striking photographs, creating engaging product presentations, or designing 3D models, I take pride in producing high-quality work that is both functional and visually appealing. My goal is to continuously improve, learn new skills, and take on exciting challenges that push me to grow both technically and creatively.
