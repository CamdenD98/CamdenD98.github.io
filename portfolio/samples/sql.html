        <p>Below is a code I wrote to for a database utlilized by a pretend company who were requesting to know what states were experiencing the most returns of their prodcuts. This code will also help identify which product was the most returned of the products sold of this company. </p>
        <pre><code>
            mysql;

            SHOW DATABASES;

            USE QuantigrationUpdates;

            SHOW TABLES;

            SELECT Collaborator.State AS State, 
            COUNT(*) AS NumberOf FROM Orders 
            INNER JOIN RMA ON Orders.OrderID = RMA.OrderID 
            INNER JOIN Collaborator ON Collaborator.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID 
            GROUP BY STATE 
            ORDER BY NumberOf DESC;

            SELECT Collaborator.State AS State, 
            (COUNT(*)*100/ (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders INNER JOIN RMA ON Orders.OrderID = RMA.OrderId)) AS PercentOf FROM Orders 
            INNER JOIN RMA ON Orders.OrderID = RMA.OrderID 
            INNER JOIN Collaborator ON Collaborator.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID 
            GROUP BY State 
            ORDER BY PercentOf DESC;

            SELECT SKU AS ProductType, Description as ProductDescription, 
            (COUNT(*)*100/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders 
            INNER JOIN RMA ON Orders.OrderID = RMA.OrderID)) 
            AS PercentageReturned FROM Orders 
            INNER JOIN RMA ON Orders.OrderID = RMA.OrderID 
            GROUP BY ProductType 
            ORDER BY PercentageReturned DESC;
