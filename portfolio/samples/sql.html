        <h2>Database Information Recall</h2>
        <p>Below is a code I wrote to for a database utlilized by a pretend company who were requesting to know what states were experiencing the most returns of their prodcuts. This code will also help identify which product was the most returned of the products sold of this company. </p>

            SELECT Collaborator.State AS State, 
            COUNT(*) AS NumberOf FROM Orders 
            INNER JOIN RMA ON Orders.OrderID = RMA.OrderID 
            INNER JOIN Collaborator ON Collaborator.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID 
            GROUP BY STATE 
            ORDER BY NumberOf DESC;

            SELECT Collaborator.State AS State,

        <h2>Database Creation and Client Information Addition</h2>
        <p>Below is the code for a databse schema that I created, QuantigrationUpdates, within my Integrated Development Environment. As you can see I created multiple tables, set the appropriate attributes and keys, and loaded the Customer's information from documents on my computer. However, after loading this information I realized one of the tables wasn't properly created so I deleted it before creating it again and redownloaded the Customer information. Then I had to recall the number of Customers regarding certain parameters such as city or state. Finally, I had to manually input a handful of Customers into the tables that were not previously found in the documents utilized for the previous information upload. </p>
