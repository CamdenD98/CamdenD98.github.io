        <h2>First Program
        </h2>
            <p>
                Below is the first Python code I ever worked on. I include this as an example that this is where we all begin on our journey of coding. No matter where we are now we all began with a simply asking a user for their name and age. I am amazed to know I went from this simple code to what I have achieved throughout my six years of education.
            </p>
        <pre><code>
            from datetime import date

            user_name = input('What is your name?')

            print('Your name is ' + user_name + '!')

            user_age = int(input('What is your age?'))

            print('You are ' + str(user_age) + ' years old!')

            today = date.today()

            current_year = int(today.strftime("%Y"))

            birth_year = current_year-user_age

            print('Hello ' + user_name + '! You were born in ' + str(birth_year) + '.')

        <h2>Text Based Game
        </h2>
            <p>
                Below is a Python video game I created in 2023. In this game you are an adventurer exploring an abandoned castle while also trying to escape without running into the ogre that calls this place home. Throughout your adventures through the castle the player is able to find different magical items to help aid them in their escape...or even to defeat the ogre. The user would simply input a cardinal direction to move around the play area. If the direction was not able to be travelled they would be met with a themed error message, otherwise they would enter a new room. Some rooms would randomly have a magical item placed into them using a randomizer which makes each play through both fun and a whole new experience.
