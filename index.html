        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>         Hello, and thank you for visiting my corner of the web! My name is Camden Dougherty, and I am a passionate professional driven by curiosity, creativity, and the belief that every challenge is an opportunity for growth.

            With a degree in Computer Science and years of diverse experience spanning project management, leadership, and creative storytelling, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and people-centered problem-solving to every endeavor. My career journey began in the dynamic world of restaurant management, where I honed my leadership skills overseeing multiple locations, managing teams of 50+ employees, and delivering exceptional guest experiences. This foundation taught me the value of adaptability, collaboration, and the power of building strong relationships.
            
            Today, I channel that same passion into creating innovative solutions, whether it’s through my work in project management software like QuickBase, my academic pursuits at Southern New Hampshire University, or my creative storytelling projects inspired by my love for immersive experiences. I thrive on finding connections—between ideas, people, and possibilities—and turning them into impactful outcomes.
            
            What inspires me most is the opportunity to make a difference. Whether I'm streamlining workflows, crafting compelling narratives, or leading a team to achieve its goals, I approach each task with optimism, resilience, and a commitment to excellence.
            
            This portfolio is a reflection of not just my skills and accomplishments but also my journey—a testament to growth, perseverance, and the belief that we can all create something extraordinary when we dare to dream big.
            
            I invite you to explore my work and connect with me to collaborate, share ideas, or simply chat about how we can shape the future together. Let’s create something meaningful!
